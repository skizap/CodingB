# Phase 15 — Configuration Updates and Installer Enhancements

## Completed Goals ✅

This phase focused on adding new configuration settings and enhancing the installer with better package management and system verification.

### Config additions ✅

All three required configuration settings have been properly implemented:

1. **`workspace_root`** - Already present in both `config.lua` and `config.sample.json`
   - Defaults to PWD or current working directory
   - Used for sandboxing file operations

2. **`terminal_allow`, `terminal_deny`** - Already present in both configuration files
   - `terminal_allow`: Whitelist of permitted command prefixes
   - `terminal_deny`: Blacklist of explicitly denied command patterns (takes precedence)

3. **`conversation_encryption`** - **Added in Phase 15**
   - Present in `config.lua` (line 21)
   - **Added to `config.sample.json`** with proper documentation
   - Enables encryption-at-rest for conversation files
   - Requires `CODINGBUDDY_PASSPHRASE` environment variable when enabled

### Installer Enhancements ✅

Enhanced the `install.sh` script with comprehensive package management and verification:

#### New Packages Added
- **ripgrep** - Fast text search tool (when available)
- **patch** - Required for applying code patches  
- **openssl** - Required for encryption functionality
- **luaossl** - Lua OpenSSL bindings (when available via luarocks)

#### System Tool Verification ✅
Added new `verify_system_tools()` function that:
- ✅ Verifies presence of **realpath**, **diff**, **patch**, **openssl**
- ✅ Warns if missing required tools
- ✅ Provides distribution-specific installation commands
- ✅ Checks for optional but recommended tools (ripgrep/rg)
- ✅ Prevents installation from continuing with missing critical tools

#### Enhanced Package Installation
Updated package installation for all supported distributions:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: Added ripgrep, patch, coreutils, openssl + luaossl via luarocks
- **Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**: Added ripgrep, patch, coreutils, openssl + luaossl via luarocks  
- **openSUSE/SLES**: Added ripgrep, patch, coreutils, openssl + luaossl via luarocks
- **Arch/Manjaro**: Added ripgrep, patch, coreutils, openssl + luaossl via luarocks

#### Improved Error Handling
- Better fallback for older systems where ripgrep might not be available
- Comprehensive package lists for unsupported distributions
- Enhanced verification and warning messages

## Files Modified

1. **`codingbuddy/config.sample.json`**
   - Added `conversation_encryption: false` setting
   - Added documentation in notes section

2. **`install.sh`**
   - Enhanced header comments for Phase 15
   - Added `verify_system_tools()` function
   - Updated package installation for all distributions
   - Integrated system verification into test suite
   - Improved error messages and user guidance

## Technical Implementation

The configuration system now supports:
- **Encryption-at-rest** for conversation files via `conversation_encryption` setting
- **Secure terminal policies** with allow/deny lists  
- **Flexible workspace sandboxing** via `workspace_root`

The installer now provides:
- **Comprehensive dependency management** across major Linux distributions
- **System tool verification** before installation completion
- **Enhanced error reporting** with actionable installation commands
- **Robust package availability checking** with graceful fallbacks

This completes Phase 15 with all required functionality implemented and tested.
